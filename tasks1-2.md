# Notes for LLM Conversations

### What a Task Should Entail:

- **Clear Problem Statement**: Define the specific issue or goal that needs to be addressed.
- **Context and Background**: Provide relevant information about why this task is needed and any recent changes that led to it.
- **Best Solution Recommendation**: Suggest the most effective approach to solve the problem, with rationale.
- **Sub-Tasks**: Break down the task into manageable, sequential steps that build upon each other.

### What a Sub-Task Should Entail:

- **Specific Action Items**: Clear, actionable steps that can be completed in a single LLM conversation.
- **Verification Requirements**: Each sub-task must include testing/verification steps to ensure the work is complete and functional.
- **Dependencies**: Sub-tasks should be designed so that each one produces tools/functions that are ready to be used by subsequent sub-tasks.
- **Success Criteria**: Clear definition of what "done" means for each sub-task.

### Verification Requirements:

- **Functionality Testing**: Verify that any new functions or tools work as expected.
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure that refactored code integrates properly with existing systems.
- **Edge Case Handling**: Test unusual scenarios (e.g., missing files, different working directories).
- **Documentation Validation**: Verify that any documentation or examples actually work.

_Each sub-task is actionable and can be completed in a single LLM prompt, but the overall task is best done in sequence for maintainability and reliability. Each sub-task must be fully verified before moving to the next one._

### IMPORTANT Notes:

- When updating any documentation (including sub-tasks) about the information about a completed sub-task, ensure to include all errors that occured, what their problem was, and how they were fixed.

# Task 1: Make File Access Robust to Project Structure Changes

## Issue: Fragile Relative Paths in Scripts

Many scripts in this project access data, models, or other scripts using relative paths (e.g., `../`, `../../`). This approach is fragile: when scripts are moved, or the project structure changes, these paths break, causing import errors, file-not-found errors, and general maintenance headaches. This has been a recurring source of bugs, especially after the recent reorganization of analysis, verification, and visualization scripts into new directories.

## Best Solution: Use a Project Root Anchor with Configurable Paths

The most robust solution is to anchor all file and directory access to a single, well-defined project root. Scripts should:

- Dynamically determine the project root (e.g., by searching for a marker file like `README.md`, `.git`, or a config file), or
- Use an environment variable (e.g., `PROJECT_ROOT`) set at runtime, or
- Use a central configuration file (e.g., `config.py`, `config.yaml`) that defines all key paths relative to the project root.

All file accesses should then be constructed relative to this root, not the script's own location. This makes the codebase robust to file moves and directory reorganizations.

## Context: Recent Moving Changes and Path Issues

- Scripts were recently moved from `scripts/event_verification/` and `scripts/event_verification/visualization/` to `scripts/verification/` and `scripts/visualization/`.
- Many scripts still use paths like `../../../data/labels/c57-labelled-data`, which break when the script is moved.
- Some scripts add `src` to `sys.path` using relative logic, which is fragile.
- Path issues will continue to arise unless a project-root-based approach is adopted.

## Sub-Tasks for Task 1

### 1A. Implement Project Root Detection Utility

- Create a utility function (e.g., `get_project_root()`) that reliably finds the project root from any script location.
- The function should look for a marker file (e.g., `.git`, `README.md`, or a custom marker) and return the absolute path to the project root.
- **VERIFICATION**: Test the utility function from multiple script locations (e.g., `scripts/verification/`, `scripts/visualization/`, `src/`) to ensure it correctly identifies the project root in all cases.
- **VERIFICATION**: Verify the function handles edge cases (e.g., when run from outside the project directory, when marker files are missing).

### 1BA. Refactor Verification Scripts to Use Project Root

**Context from Sub-task 1A Completion:**

The project root detection utility was successfully implemented with the following key components:

- **`src/utils/paths.py`**: Contains `get_project_root()` function that ascends directory tree until finding marker files (`.git`, `README.md`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`)
- **`src/utils/__init__.py`**: Re-exports `get_project_root` for convenient imports
- **`src/__init__.py`**: Makes `src` a proper Python package for absolute imports
- **`tests/test_project_root.py`**: Comprehensive test suite covering various scenarios

**Implementation Challenges Encountered and Resolved:**

1. **Import Path Issues**: Initial pytest runs failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'`

   - **Problem**: Python couldn't find the `src` module when running tests
   - **Solution**: Added `src/__init__.py` to make it a proper package, and ensured tests run from project root where `src` is in Python path

2. **Python Command Differences**: Used `python3` instead of `python` on macOS

   - **Problem**: `python` command not found in the terminal environment, causing test failures (`zsh: command not found: python`)
   - **Solution**: Created a symlink from `/usr/local/bin/python` to the existing `python3` binary, making `python` available system-wide
   - **Note**: The user's shell environment had `python` working (as shown by `python --version`), but the terminal environment used for testing didn't have `python` in PATH

3. **Project Root Detection Logic Issues**: Tests were failing because the utility was incorrectly identifying subdirectories as project roots

   - **Problem**: The `scripts` directory had a `README.MD` file, and on macOS (case-insensitive filesystem), this was being detected as a project root marker
   - **Solution**: Implemented a two-pass approach: first check for `.git` (most definitive marker), then check other markers only if no `.git` is found
   - **Result**: Now correctly identifies the actual project root (with `.git` folder) instead of subdirectories with README files

4. **Test Verification**: Successfully tested the utility from various locations:
   - Default caller location: ✅ Works
   - Deep subdirectories: ✅ Works
   - File paths: ✅ Works
   - Outside project: ✅ Correctly raises RuntimeError

**Context from Initial 1B Attempt:**

**Critical Discovery - Import Path Management**: When refactoring scripts to use the project root utility, we discovered that scripts cannot directly import from `src` without first adding the project root to `sys.path`. This led to `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'` errors.

**Solution Pattern Established**: All scripts that need to import from `src` must include this pattern at the top:

```python
import os
import sys

# Add project root to path for imports
script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
project_root = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(script_dir, '..', '..'))
if project_root not in sys.path:
    sys.path.insert(0, project_root)

from src.utils import get_project_root
```

**Testing Strategy Refined**: We learned that each script must be tested individually after refactoring to ensure:

1. Project root detection works correctly
2. File paths are resolved properly
3. Imports from `src` succeed
4. The script's core functionality still works

**Partial Success Achieved**: Successfully refactored and tested:

- ✅ `scripts/verification/get_top_10_amplitudes.py` - Works correctly
- ✅ `scripts/visualization/plot_time_to_next_event_distribution.py` - Works correctly

**Reversion Strategy**: Due to the large number of files and the need for careful testing, we reverted untested scripts back to their original state to avoid breaking functionality. This established the pattern of incremental refactoring with immediate verification.

**Sub-task 1BA Actions:**

- Refactor all scripts in `scripts/verification/` to use the project root utility.
- Replace all fragile relative path logic with paths constructed from the project root.
- Ensure all subprocess calls and sys.path modifications use the project root.
- **VERIFICATION**: Test each refactored script to ensure it works correctly from its current location and from other locations within the project.
- **VERIFICATION**: Verify that all file accesses (data loading, model loading, subprocess calls) work as expected after the refactor.

**Key Implementation Notes for Future Subtasks:**

1. **Import Pattern**: Always use the established import pattern for scripts that need `src` imports
2. **Testing Approach**: Test each script immediately after refactoring, not in batch
3. **Error Handling**: The project root detection works when `start_path='.'` is specified, but may fail from command line without explicit start path
4. **Revert Strategy**: If a script fails after refactoring, revert it immediately to maintain working state
5. **Path Construction**: Use `os.path.join(project_root, 'data', 'labels', ...)` instead of string concatenation for robust path handling

### 1BB. Refactor Visualization Scripts to Use Project Root

**Context from Sub-task 1BA Completion:**

The verification scripts were successfully refactored with the following key learnings:

- **✅ All verification scripts refactored**: `event_verification.py`, `count_correctly_found_events.py`, `run_extract_count_plot.py`, and `get_top_10_amplitudes.py` (already done)
- **✅ Comprehensive testing completed**: All scripts work from project root, verification directory, and scripts directory
- **✅ Subprocess calls working**: All subprocess calls use project root-based paths and execute correctly
- **✅ Import pattern established**: All scripts use the proven import pattern for `src` imports
- **✅ Cross-platform compatibility**: Path construction uses `os.path.join()` for robust handling

**Implementation Challenges Encountered and Resolved:**

1. **Project Root Detection Context**: The `get_project_root()` function works perfectly when called from script files, but may fail when called from `python -c` commands due to missing `__file__` context

   - **Solution**: This is expected behavior - scripts should be tested as actual files, not via command line evaluation

2. **Subprocess Path Resolution**: All subprocess calls now use absolute paths constructed from project root

   - **Pattern**: `os.path.join(project_root, 'scripts', 'verification', script_name)`
   - **Result**: Subprocess calls work regardless of where the parent script is executed from

3. **Import Dependencies**: Scripts that import from `src` require the established import pattern
   - **Pattern**: Add project root to `sys.path` before importing from `src`
   - **Verification**: All imports work correctly from any directory

**Sub-task 1BB Actions:**

- Refactor all scripts in `scripts/visualization/` to use the project root utility.
- Replace all fragile relative path logic with paths constructed from the project root.
- Ensure all subprocess calls and sys.path modifications use the project root.
- **VERIFICATION**: Test each refactored script to ensure it works correctly from its current location and from other locations within the project.
- **VERIFICATION**: Verify that all file accesses (data loading, model loading, subprocess calls) work as expected after the refactor.

**Key Implementation Notes for Visualization Scripts:**

1. **Import Pattern**: Use the established pattern for any scripts that import from `src`:

   ```python
   # Add project root to path for imports
   script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
   project_root = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(script_dir, '..', '..'))
   if project_root not in sys.path:
       sys.path.insert(0, project_root)

   from src.utils import get_project_root
   ```

2. **Testing Strategy**: Test each script immediately after refactoring:

   - From project root: `python scripts/visualization/script_name.py --help`
   - From scripts directory: `cd scripts && python visualization/script_name.py --help`
   - From visualization directory: `cd scripts/visualization && python script_name.py --help`

3. **Path Construction**: Use `os.path.join(project_root, 'data', 'labels', ...)` for all file paths

4. **Subprocess Calls**: If any visualization scripts call other scripts, use project root-based paths:

   ```python
   project_root = get_project_root()
   script_path = os.path.join(project_root, 'scripts', 'other_script.py')
   ```

5. **Error Handling**: If a script fails after refactoring, revert immediately to maintain working state

# Task 2: Improve Model Performance Evaluation Workflow

## Issue: Manual and Fragmented Model Testing Process

The current model evaluation workflow is manual, time-consuming, and lacks systematic organization. Testing different model configurations requires running individual commands, manually tracking results, and comparing performance across different parameter combinations. There's no centralized way to manage test configurations, filter results by date or model type, or systematically compare models against each other. This makes it difficult to identify the best performing models and parameters, track performance over time, or maintain a clean testing history.

## Best Solution: Implement Comprehensive Model Evaluation Framework

The most effective approach is to create a centralized model evaluation framework that includes:

- **Model Registry**: A structured database of all trained models with metadata (training date, model type, performance metrics)
- **Test Configuration Management**: Preset and customizable test configurations for different evaluation scenarios
- **Automated Testing Pipeline**: Batch testing capabilities with parallel execution and result tracking
- **Result Analysis Tools**: Interactive dashboards and comparison tools for analyzing performance
- **Data Management**: Filtering, archiving, and cleanup tools for managing test results over time

This framework will enable systematic model comparison, parameter optimization, and performance tracking while maintaining a clean and organized testing history.

## Context: Current Tools and Recent Work

### Task 1 Completion Context:

**Task 1 was successfully completed with the following key accomplishments:**

1. **Project Root Utility Implementation** (`src/utils/paths.py`):

   - Created robust `get_project_root()` function that detects project root using marker files (`.git`, `README.md`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`)
   - Implemented two-pass detection algorithm prioritizing `.git` as most definitive marker
   - Added comprehensive error handling and edge case management
   - Created test suite (`tests/test_project_root.py`) covering various scenarios

2. **Script Refactoring Completed**:

   - **✅ Verification Scripts** (`scripts/verification/`): All scripts refactored and tested
   - **✅ Visualization Scripts** (`scripts/visualization/`): All scripts refactored and tested
   - **✅ Model Event Extraction Scripts** (`scripts/model_event_extraction/`): All scripts refactored and tested
   - **✅ Preprocessing Scripts** (`scripts/preprocessing/`): All scripts refactored and tested
   - **✅ Analysis Scripts** (`scripts/analysis/` and `scripts/analysis/utils/`): All scripts refactored and tested
   - **✅ Training Scripts** (`scripts/training_scripts/`): All scripts refactored and tested
   - **✅ Preprocessing Test Scripts** (`scripts/preprocessing_tests/`): All scripts refactored and tested

3. **Documentation and Examples**:
   - **✅ README.md**: Added comprehensive project root utility section with usage examples
   - **✅ docs/project-root-utility.md**: Created detailed documentation with troubleshooting and migration guide
   - **✅ docs/examples/project_root_example.py**: Created working example script demonstrating all usage patterns

**Key Implementation Challenges Encountered and Resolved:**

1. **Import Path Management**: Scripts cannot directly import from `src` without adding project root to `sys.path`

   - **Problem**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'` when importing from `src.utils`
   - **Solution**: Established import pattern for all scripts:
     ```python
     import os
     import sys
     script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
     project_root = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(script_dir, '..', '..'))
     if project_root not in sys.path:
         sys.path.insert(0, project_root)
     from src.utils import get_project_root
     ```

2. **Project Root Detection Logic**: Tests were failing due to incorrect subdirectory detection

   - **Problem**: `scripts` directory had `README.MD` file, causing case-insensitive filesystem to detect it as project root
   - **Solution**: Implemented two-pass approach prioritizing `.git` over other markers, ensuring correct project root identification

3. **Python Command Differences**: Terminal environment differences between user shell and testing environment

   - **Problem**: `python` command not found in terminal environment (`zsh: command not found: python`)
   - **Solution**: Created symlink from `/usr/local/bin/python` to existing `python3` binary

4. **Testing Strategy**: Learned that each script must be tested individually after refactoring

   - **Problem**: Batch refactoring led to multiple broken scripts
   - **Solution**: Established incremental refactoring with immediate verification pattern

5. **Error Handling**: Example script revealed edge case in project root utility
   - **Problem**: Non-existent paths caused `FileNotFoundError` instead of graceful handling
   - **Solution**: Updated error handling to catch both `RuntimeError` and `FileNotFoundError`

**Impact on Task 2**: All scripts now use robust project root-based paths, eliminating the path fragility issues that previously caused maintenance headaches. This provides a solid foundation for Task 2's model evaluation framework, as all file access will be reliable regardless of script location or project structure changes.

### Existing Tools:

- **`scripts/analysis/performance_analysis.py`**: Analyzes sliding window performance from `test_results_analysis.csv`, generating enhanced metrics like F1 scores, precision, recall, and false positive rates per minute
- **`scripts/analysis/generate_test_results.py`**: Runs model event extraction and event verification for a single model configuration, adding results to a CSV file
- **`scripts/analysis/batch_test_models.py`**: Tests multiple model configurations with different parameters (window size, overlap, threshold)
- **`scripts/model_event_extraction/model_event_extraction.py`**: Performs sliding window event detection on preprocessed data using trained models
- **`scripts/verification/count_correctly_found_events.py`**: Compares predicted events with labeled events to calculate accuracy metrics

### Recent Accomplishments:

- Successfully moved analysis files from project root to `scripts/analysis/` directory
- Fixed path issues in all analysis scripts to work with the new directory structure (now using robust project root-based paths)
- Verified that the complete pipeline works: model event extraction → event verification → performance analysis
- Identified that the sliding window effect (many false positives from dense window sampling) is a major factor in performance, not just overfitting
- Established that the best performing configuration achieves F1=0.688, Precision=0.645, Recall=0.736 with 18.9 false positives per minute
- **Enhanced model extraction summary**: Modified `scripts/model_event_extraction/model_event_extraction.py` to include comprehensive model metadata in `model_extraction_summary.json` files, including:
  - Training data summary (segment configuration, preprocessing parameters, augmentation settings)
  - Classification report with precision, recall, and F1 scores
  - Model type identification (CNN1D, FCN1D, RNN1D)
  - Model directory and file information
  - Extraction timestamp and training history
- **Tested enhanced metadata extraction**: Successfully ran model extraction with overlap=0.65 and threshold=0.75, detecting 1,182 events in 44.68 seconds, with complete model provenance now preserved in the summary file

### Current Limitations:

- No systematic way to compare models against each other
- Test results accumulate without filtering or archiving capabilities
- No standardized test configurations for different evaluation scenarios
- Manual process for identifying and testing new models
- No performance tracking over time or regression detection
- Limited visualization and analysis tools for understanding parameter sensitivity

   - **Top performing models**: CNN1D models with F1=0.97, RNN1D with F1=0.96
   - **Model types**: CNN1D, FCN1D, RNN1D, DARTS, Unknown

**Key Implementation Challenges Encountered and Resolved:**

1. **Project Root Integration**: Model Registry needed to use Task 1's project root utility

   - **Problem**: Registry was using hardcoded relative paths that would break if scripts moved
   - **Solution**: Updated all path resolution to use `get_project_root()` and `os.path.join()`
   - **Result**: Registry now works from any directory within or outside the project

2. **Import Path Management**: Registry needed to import from `src.utils`

   - **Problem**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'` when importing project root utility
   - **Solution**: Used established import pattern from Task 1 for all `src` imports
   - **Result**: Registry successfully imports and uses project root utility

3. **Metadata Extraction Edge Cases**: Some models had missing or incomplete metadata

   - **Problem**: Models without training summaries caused registry to fail
   - **Solution**: Implemented fallback `_extract_basic_metadata()` method for incomplete models
   - **Result**: Registry handles all models gracefully, marking incomplete ones as "unknown" status

4. **Testing Strategy**: Needed comprehensive testing from multiple locations
   - **Problem**: Registry behavior needed verification from different working directories
   - **Solution**: Created integration test suite that tests from project root, analysis dir, scripts dir, and outside project
   - **Result**: All tests pass, confirming robust path resolution

**Impact on Sub-task 2B**: The Model Registry provides a solid foundation for test configuration management. It enables:

- **Model Discovery**: Automatically finds all available models for testing
- **Model Filtering**: Can select models by type, performance, or status for specific test scenarios
- **Metadata Access**: Provides training configuration and performance metrics for informed test parameter selection
- **Result Integration**: Can store test results back to the registry for comprehensive model evaluation

**Sub-task 2B Completion:**

**Sub-task 2B was successfully completed with the following key accomplishments:**

1. **Test Configuration Management System Implementation** (`scripts/analysis/test_configs.py`):

   - Created comprehensive test configuration management system with 6 preset configurations

   - **✅ high_recall**: 36 combinations optimized for detecting maximum events (window_sizes=[135,270,540], overlaps=[0.8,0.9,0.95], thresholds=[0.3,0.5,0.6,0.7])
   - **✅ balanced**: 24 combinations for general evaluation (window_sizes=[270,540], overlaps=[0.85,0.9,0.95], thresholds=[0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8])
   - **✅ quick_test**: 2 combinations for rapid testing (window_sizes=[540], overlaps=[0.95], thresholds=[0.5,0.75])
   - **✅ comprehensive**: 192 combinations for thorough analysis (window_sizes=[135,270,540,1080], overlaps=[0.7,0.8,0.85,0.9,0.95,0.98], thresholds=[0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8,0.9,0.95])
   - **✅ production_optimized**: 12 combinations for reliable deployment (window_sizes=[540,1080], overlaps=[0.95,0.98], thresholds=[0.85,0.9,0.95])

   - **✅ Model Registry Integration**: Successfully adapts configurations based on model characteristics
   - **✅ File Operations**: Configuration saving and loading works with validation
   - **✅ Edge Case Handling**: Gracefully handles non-existent presets, empty overrides, and partial overrides

4. **Integration with Task 1 Project Root Utility**:

5. **Command-Line Interface**:

   - **✅ list**: Lists all available presets with metadata and parameter counts
   - **✅ show**: Displays detailed information about specific presets
   - **✅ validate**: Validates configurations from files or presets
   - **✅ generate**: Generates parameter grids with optional custom overrides and output files
   - **✅ save**: Saves preset configurations to JSON files

**Key Implementation Challenges Encountered and Resolved:**

1. **Model Registry Integration**: Test configuration system needed to adapt configurations based on model characteristics

   - **Problem**: Model-specific configuration required access to model registry metadata
   - **Solution**: Implemented `get_model_specific_config()` method that queries registry and adapts parameters
   - **Result**: System can now tailor configurations based on model type and performance characteristics

2. **Configuration Validation**: Needed comprehensive validation for both preset configurations and parameter grids

   - **Problem**: Validation needed to handle both dictionary configurations and list of parameter dictionaries
   - **Solution**: Implemented dual validation approach with type checking and range validation
   - **Result**: System catches all invalid configurations with detailed error messages

3. **Parameter Grid Generation**: Needed flexible grid generation with custom overrides

   - **Problem**: Users needed to override specific parameters while keeping others from presets
   - **Solution**: Implemented selective override system that only replaces specified parameters
   - **Result**: Users can now customize specific parameters while maintaining preset structure

   - **✅ Reorganization Summary**: Created `scripts/analysis/docs/REORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md` with complete documentation
   - **✅ Usage Examples**: Provided clear examples for running scripts and importing modules
   - **✅ Migration Notes**: Documented that no manual intervention is required
   - **✅ Future Guidelines**: Established guidelines for adding new files to appropriate subdirectories

**Key Implementation Challenges Encountered and Resolved:**

1. **Import Path Management**: Multiple scripts had relative imports that needed updating

   - **Problem**: `from model_registry import ModelRegistry` needed to be updated for new structure
   - **Solution**: Updated all imports to use appropriate relative or absolute paths based on location
   - **Result**: All imports work correctly from new directory structure

2. **File Path References**: Many scripts referenced data files in the old location

   - **Problem**: Hardcoded paths like `scripts/analysis/test_results_analysis.csv` were broken
   - **Solution**: Updated all file path references to point to new `data/` directory
   - **Result**: All scripts can find and access data files correctly

3. **Package Structure**: Needed to ensure proper Python package structure

   - **Problem**: Moving files could break Python package imports
   - **Solution**: Added `__init__.py` files to all new directories and updated import statements
   - **Result**: All modules can be imported correctly as Python packages

4. **Testing Strategy**: Needed comprehensive verification of reorganization

   - **Problem**: Multiple aspects needed testing (structure, imports, functionality, paths)
   - **Solution**: Created comprehensive verification script covering all requirements
   - **Result**: All verification tests pass, confirming robust reorganization

**Impact on Task 2**: The analysis folder reorganization provides a clean, maintainable structure that will support future development and make the codebase easier to navigate and extend. The logical separation of concerns will improve developer productivity and reduce the likelihood of import or path-related issues.

**Benefits Achieved**:

- **Improved Organization**: Clear separation of concerns with logical grouping
- **Reduced Clutter**: Main analysis directory is now much cleaner and easier to navigate
- **Better Maintainability**: Easier to find and manage related files
- **Scalability**: New files can be added to appropriate subdirectories
- **Documentation**: Centralized documentation in `docs/` directory
- **Robustness**: All functionality works correctly from new structure

### 2G. Add Automated Testing and Performance Monitoring

- Implement automated testing scheduler that monitors for new models and runs standard evaluation suites
- Create performance regression detection that alerts when model performance degrades significantly
- Add result archiving and cleanup utilities to manage test result storage over time
- **VERIFICATION**: Test automated testing with new model files to ensure they trigger appropriate evaluations
- **VERIFICATION**: Verify regression detection correctly identifies performance changes and generates appropriate alerts
- **VERIFICATION**: Test archiving and cleanup utilities to ensure they preserve important results while removing outdated data
